# CLAUDE.md

Context for AI coding agents working in this repo. Read `docs/00-brief.md` through
`docs/05-cost.md` before making changes.

## What this is

A daily country-silhouette guessing game served at `lisecki.dev/mondo/`, built for a small
competitive group. Vanilla frontend published from `site/` by GitHub Pages, Firebase backend.

## Invariants — never violate these

1. **The server holds the answer.** The country for an in-progress round must never appear in
   any response body, DOM node, asset path, filename, or console log. Every guess is evaluated
   in a Cloud Function. If a change would put the answer on the client early, stop and flag it.
2. **No client writes to score-bearing data.** `puzzles`, `attempts`, `challenges`,
   `groups/*/results`, `groups/*/standings` are Admin-SDK-only. Firestore rules default-deny.
3. **Server timestamps only.** Never trust client-supplied time for anything scored.
4. **No build step on the frontend.** Vanilla ES modules, Firebase SDK via CDN ESM import.
   Do not introduce a bundler, framework, or transpiler into `site/`.
5. **No secrets in the repo.** No service-account JSON, no `.env`. CI uses Workload Identity
   Federation.
6. **Email addresses are never exposed to other users.** Display names only.
7. **Never set `minInstances` on a function without reading `docs/05-cost.md` §3.1.** One
   always-warm instance costs an order of magnitude more than the whole free tier and bills
   when nobody is playing. Cold starts are free; warm instances are not.
8. **`tools/out/` is gitignored.** It holds the generated puzzle schedule. Committing it leaks
   every answer.

## Conventions

- Backend is TypeScript, Cloud Functions v2, Node 22, region `southamerica-east1`.
- All backend entry points are **callable** functions, not raw HTTP.
- Every callable: assert auth, validate input against an explicit schema, then act. No exceptions.
- Scoring and geo maths live in `backend/functions/src/lib/` as pure, unit-tested functions.
  Business rules do not live in handlers.
- Frontend files are lowercase, hyphenated. Page names are pt-BR (`grupos.html`, `desafio.html`).
- Firestore document IDs are deterministic where possible (`{uid}_{puzzleId}`) so writes are
  idempotent.
- Reference requirement IDs (`FR-2.7`, `SEC-3`) in commit messages and PR descriptions.

## Before you finish a task

- If you touched `firestore.rules`, add or update rules tests — including **negative** cases.
- If you touched scoring, run the unit tests and state what changed in plain language, because
  humans will argue about it.
- If you touched the geo pipeline, regenerate `tools/preview.html` and say so, so a human can
  eyeball the silhouettes.
- Never commit anything under `tools/out/`.

## Things that are deliberate, not oversights

- Only the largest landmass of each country is rendered. France is metropolitan France. This is
  decision D-8; see `docs/03-geo-data-pipeline.md` §3.1.
- `shapeKey` values are random, not derived from country codes. Deriving them would create a
  rainbow table and defeat invariant 1.
- Challenge creators do not choose the country and play blind. Decision D-10.
- Territories and dependencies are excluded from the country pool. Changes go through
  `tools/include.json` via pull request.
